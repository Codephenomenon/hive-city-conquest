    <p>A <em>Hivecity Conquest</em> campaign can be played with any number of participants, though it's ideally suited for two to four players. To begin, create a campaign which generates you a Cityscape, where each player claims a is given territory. The campaign then unfolds over a series of rounds, each made up of two distinct phases:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Action phase</li>
      <li>Strategy phase</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the Action phase, players engage in one or more battles against their rivals, keeping track of each outcome. After each battle, players earn glory points, which reflect their performance during the current round of the campaign.</p>
    <p>Once the Action phase is over, players regroup around the Cityscape map to carry out the Strategy phase. During this phase, territories may be gained or lost, and campaign points are awarded based on each player's progress. Players also receive strategy points, which can be spent on Campaign Stratagems to gain an edge in future battles or throughout the campaign. When the campaign concludes, the player with the highest total campaign points is declared the winner.</p>
    <h2>City Hexmap</h2>
    <p>The Cityscape map is a hex-based grid layout where location tiles are placed to create the city that serves as the setting for your campaign. On the left side of the map, there's a tracker for each player to monitor their campaign and strategy points. The map also features interfaces for Player Information and any active <strong>Strategic Resources</strong>. At the top, there are two more panels - one for a <strong>Strategic Goals</strong> and another for a <strong>Random Events</strong>.</p>
